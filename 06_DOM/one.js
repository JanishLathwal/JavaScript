// DOM :- Document Object Model!
// A Tree like structure of the HTML web page in which we call each element as node! eg. text node etc. 

// basically it is a structural diagram of the HTML code in tree str.

// When a web page is loaded, the browser turns the HTML into a tree-like structure called the DOM. It represents all the elements on the page (like headings, paragraphs, buttons, etc.) in a way that programming languages like JavaScript can interact with.
